How to use Griffin PowerMate Dial with PsychoPy:
Created by Ilkay Isik

Here is the documentation on how to get response from Griffin Powermate dial
if you are programming your experiment with Psychopy.
Unfortunately this is only for windows.

Go to this link (https://github.com/ofgulban/griffin-powermate)and download
the library.
This script uses a python library (pywinusb.hid) to talk to any usb device. This library needs to be in PsychoPy2/Lib/site-packages [https://github.com/rene-aguirre/pywinusb]

In short what it does is;
* It defines a class called GriffinPowermate which can:
    *  find the power mate dial you plugged in using the HidDeviceFilter from
       the pywinusb library.
    *  and listen to its activity.

Data format:
It spits out some numbers in a format like this when you include the function
raw listener in your script :
data = [0, button_status, move, 0, bright, pulse_status, pulse_value]
They all correspond to a different event
button_status: is there a click or not
move is about the rotation. It gives a value between 1 and 255. if the dial is
turned right the value is 1 or above (depending on how fast you turn)
if the dial is turned left the value is 255 or below.
Move is probably the most important response type you want to record.


Usage:
What you have to do is put this script in the same directory where your
experiment script sits and also import the class from the library in the
beginning of your script :

* “from griffin_powermate import GriffinPowermate”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are two examples on how to use it in your script:

EXAMPLE 1: uses only the rotation (move)

"""Test Griffin Powermate library."""

from griffin_powermate import GriffinPowermate

def rotation_listener(data):
    """Print powermate input only for rotation."""
    if data[2] > 127:
        print data[2] - 256
    else:
        print data[2]


devices = GriffinPowermate.find_all()

# use the first powermate available
powermate = devices[0]
powermate.open()
powermate.on_event('raw', rotation_listener)

# set the light (0 - 255)
powermate.set_brightness(0)

while True:
    x = 1

powermate.close()
win.close()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLE 2: uses rotation and click
"""Test Griffin Powermate library."""

import numpy as np
from griffin_powermate import GriffinPowermate


out = []
dial_click = False

def rotation_listener(data):
    """Print powermate input only for rotation and click."""
    global dial_click
    if data[1] == 1 :
        dial_click = True
    elif data[2] > 127:
        out.append(data[2] - 256)
    else:
        out.append(data[2])


devices = GriffinPowermate.find_all()

# use the first powermate available
powermate = devices[0]
powermate.open()
powermate.on_event('raw', rotation_listener)

# set the light (0 - 255)
powermate.set_brightness(0)

while dial_click is False:
    x = 1

print np.sum(out)

powermate.close()
